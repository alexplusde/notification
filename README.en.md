# Scheduled notifications for REDAXO

With this addon, editors can display time-controlled notification messages in the frontend, which appear either at certain points (as a module), globally (as a template), as well as once (to be clicked away) or permanently (until the expiry date).

For example for:

* Leave, vacation and absence times
* Special offers and limited promotions
* Delivery difficulties or current restrictions

## features

* Fully implemented with **YForm** : All features and customization options of YForm available
* Simple: The output is via [`rex_sql`](https://redaxo.org/doku/master/datenbank-queries) or object-oriented via [YOrm](https://github.com/yakamara/redaxo_yform_docs/blob/master/de_de/yorm.md)
* Flexible: Ready-made fragments for Bootstrap 5 alerts and toasts
* Useful: Only selected **roles**/editors have access

> **Contribute your own improvements** to the [Notifications](https://github.com/alexplusde/notification) GitHub repository. Or **support this addon:** With a [sponsorship or an assignment you support the further development of this addon](https://github.com/sponsors/alexplusde)
